## Getting Started

If you want to start application in development mode please run :

```bash
npm run dev

```

Or for production build please run :

```bash
npm run build
# And
npm run start

```

NOTE : The project can still be much better, the axios routes can be broken into different files in the api folder, and some optimization fixes with more following SOLID principles `(:`
